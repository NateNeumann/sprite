# Full files for Sprite

These are the complete files from the KickSat Sprite repo. As most are only useful for developers experienced with the kit, they have been moved here for organization purposes within the demo repo.

The bulk of these files consist of detailing the design and details of the Sprite board; please browse if you are interested in understanding how the Sprite board functions, or you wish to develop in an environment other than Energia, such as GCC with Eclipse.
