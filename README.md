Demo in programming for a tiny open source spacecraft! 

# Introduction

The Sprite board is a computer made on one circuit board, intended to be a used as a miniature spacecraft.

Because of the weight limitations imposed by being intended for space use, it is designed to be quite light and simple, but it comes built-in with many of the same sensors and processing tools as are in your smartphones and computers.

To get started with the introductory demo, please visit the [Demo Instructions page](https://github.com/NateNeumann/sprite/wiki/Demo-Instructions) in the Wiki.

# Acknowledgments

The code for Sprite, and in this repo, is derived from work by [@zacmanchester](https://github.com/zacmanchester), builder of KickSat and Assistant Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford University. Many thanks to the [KickSat project](http://kicksat.github.io/); more information can be found on the [project KickStarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/251588730/kicksat-your-personal-spacecraft-in-space/posts) and the [KickSat Wiki](https://github.com/zacmanchester/kicksat/wiki).

This demo would not be possible without the assistance and guidance of [Michael Turner -- @Yakushima](https://github.com/ProjectPersephone), Executive Director of [Project Persephone](http://www.projectpersephone.org/).
